Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

Display this list of items to the user based on the following requirements:

- Display all the items grouped by "listId"
- Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
- Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.

## Running the project
Should just work out of the box.
This was built using AS Ladybug 2024.2.1 Patch 2 and tested on API 27, 33, 34, and 35

## Other notes?
Don't mind the long time spans between the commits. This has been quite the trying week.
I keep a JIRA board for projects, hence the ticket name that prefixes commits.
I am not great at Compose yet. Most projects I have done personally and professionally are still in XML due to being legacy projects.
